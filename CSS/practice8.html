            <p>
                Meet Jerry, our adorable Labrador puppy who’s basically a ball of sunshine wrapped in fur! ☀️🐶 With his floppy ears, sparkly eyes, and endlessly wagging tail, he turns every moment into pure joy. Whether he’s chasing his favorite toy, sneaking away with socks, or curling up for a cozy nap, Jerry has mastered the art of making hearts melt. He greets everyone like an old friend and believes every snack belongs to him. Life with Jerry means muddy paws, wet nose kisses, and unlimited love — because he’s not just a puppy, he’s pure happiness on four paws! 💛
